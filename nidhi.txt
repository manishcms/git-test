A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits

git clone https://github.com/manishcms/git-test.git (make copy of all files on your local)
git branch(to see current branch)
git fetch
git checkout develop(for switch)
git remote -v(show origin)
(Git checkout -b <branchName>
Or
Git branch <branchName>) for make branch
